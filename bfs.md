# Breadth-First Search

**Input**: An unweighted graph and a start vertex u

**Idea**:

 - Maintain a set R of vertices that have been reached but not searched and
 - a set S of vertices that have been searched.
 - The set R is maintained as a First-In First-Out list ([queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_%28abstract_data_type%29))

**Initialization**: $R = {u}, S = Ã¸, d(u,u) = 0$

**Iteration**: As long as $R \neq \varnothing $, we search from the first vertex v of R. The neighbors of v not in $S \cup R$ are added to the back of R and then v is removed from the front of R and placed in S.

## Example

Let G be the adjacency graph of the following Go shape: 


       1  2  3  4  5  6
     1    .  o  o  o  .
     2    .  .  .  .  .  <--- black component
     3    .

 | v | R | S |
 |---|---|---|
 | (2,1) | [(2,1)] | {} |
 | (2,1) | [(2,2)] | {(2,1)} |
 | (2,2) | [(2,3),(3,2)] | {(2,1),(2,2)} |
 | (2,3) | [(3,2)] | {(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)} |
 | (3,2) | [(4,2)] | {(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2)} |
 | (4,2) | [(5,2)] | {(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,2)} |
 | (5,2) | [(6,2)] | {(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2)} |
 | (6,2) | [(6,1)] | {(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(6,2)} |
 | (6,1) | [] | {(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(6,2),(6,1)} |
